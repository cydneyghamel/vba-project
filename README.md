# VBA Project

For this project, I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

## Moderate solution option: 

Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

## Hard solution

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

NOTE:

I made sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Other Considerations
I used the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing my code. This dataset is smaller and will allows to test faster. The code should run in under 3-5 minutes

The script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button!
